The goal of the project is to develop a collaboration platform tailored for small and medium-sized organizations. To achieve this goal, we have implemented various API endpoints to provide the necessary functionality for the project.

**Completed Endpoints:**

1. **User Endpoints:** These endpoints handle user-related operations such as user creation, authentication, and retrieval of user data. They ensure that users can securely register, log in, and manage their profiles within the platform.

2. **Organization Endpoints:** These endpoints facilitate organization management tasks, including organization creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. They allow organizations to establish and maintain their presence on the platform effectively.

3. **Team Endpoints:** These endpoints are designed to support team-related functionalities. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete teams as needed. This enables organizations to structure their teams and manage team-related activities seamlessly.

4. **Project Endpoints:** Project endpoints facilitate various operations related to project management within organizations. Users can create new projects by providing essential details such as project name, description, and organization ID. Additionally, users can retrieve existing projects to view their details, update project information as needed, and delete projects that are no longer required. These endpoints play a crucial role in enabling efficient project management and fostering collaboration among team members within an organization.

5. **Project Manager Assignment Endpoint:** The Project Manager Assignment endpoint allows users to assign project managers to specific projects within an organization. Users can specify the project ID, the user ID of the project manager, and the role of the project manager (defaulted to "Project Manager"). This endpoint facilitates effective delegation of project management responsibilities, ensuring that projects have dedicated managers overseeing their progress and coordinating team efforts.

6. **Team Assignment to Project:** This endpoint will allow teams to be assigned to specific projects. It will enable organizations to allocate resources and assign teams to projects based on project requirements and team capabilities.

**Upcoming Endpoints:**

1. **Task Assignment to Team Members:** This endpoint will facilitate the assignment of tasks to team members within projects. It will empower project managers to delegate tasks, track progress, and ensure efficient task management within teams.

2. **Feedbacks:** Feedback endpoints will enable team members to provide feedback on tasks, projects, and team performance. This feature fosters a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration by encouraging open communication and constructive feedback among team members.

By implementing these endpoints, our collaboration platform aims to provide organizations with the tools and functionalities they need to streamline their operations, enhance team collaboration, and drive project success. Each endpoint is designed to be intuitive, efficient, and secure, ensuring a seamless user experience and enabling organizations to achieve their collaboration goals effectively.
