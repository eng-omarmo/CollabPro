The project's objective is to develop a collaboration platform tailored for small and medium-sized organizations. To achieve this goal, we've implemented various API endpoints to provide essential functionality for the project.

**Completed Endpoints:**

1. **Organization Endpoints:** These endpoints handle organization-related operations such as organization creation, authentication, and retrieval of organization data. They ensure that organizations can securely register, log in, and manage their profiles within the platform.

2. **Team Endpoints:** These endpoints facilitate team management tasks, including team creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. They allow organizations to establish and maintain their teams effectively.

3. **Project Endpoints:** These endpoints facilitate various operations related to project management within organizations. Organizations can create new projects by providing essential details such as project name, description, and organization ID. Additionally, organizations can retrieve existing projects to view their details, update project information as needed, and delete projects that are no longer required. These endpoints play a crucial role in enabling efficient project management and fostering collaboration among team members within an organization.

4. **Project Manager Assignment Endpoint:** This endpoint allows organizations to assign project managers to specific projects within an organization. Organizations can specify the project ID, the user ID of the project manager, and the role of the project manager (defaulted to "Project Manager"). This endpoint facilitates effective delegation of project management responsibilities, ensuring that projects have dedicated managers overseeing their progress and coordinating team efforts.

5. **Team Assignment to Project:** This endpoint allows teams to be assigned to specific projects. It enables organizations to allocate resources and assign teams to projects based on project requirements and team capabilities.

6. **Task Assignment to Team Members:** This endpoint facilitates the assignment of tasks to team members within projects. It empowers project managers to delegate tasks, track progress, and ensure efficient task management within teams.

7. **Comment:** Feature 6 has not been thoroughly tested yet, but the endpoint has been created.

**Upcoming Endpoints:**

1. **Feedbacks:** Feedback endpoints will enable team members to provide feedback on tasks, projects, and team performance. This feature fosters a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration by encouraging open communication and constructive feedback among team members.

2. **To-Dos:** This endpoint will allow every organization to create to-do lists, update, delete, and mark tasks as done. It will facilitate every organization in creating schedules for themselves of their to-dos.

3. **Group Messaging for Teams:** This endpoint will enable teams within organizations to have groups where they can send messages and chat. Only members of the same organization, team, or project manager/administrator of the organization can view their chat.

By implementing these endpoints, our collaboration platform aims to provide organizations with the tools and functionalities they need to streamline their operations, enhance team collaboration, and drive project success. Each endpoint is designed to be intuitive, efficient, and secure, ensuring a seamless user experience and enabling organizations to achieve their collaboration goals effectively.
